          If you decide to develop your own application, sooner or later, you will face the challenge of choosing the right technologies and
          methods to reach your users. There are several approaches, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            While we are accustomed to the relative freedom of the internet, app distribution is largely constrained by the rules of major
            tech companies. There is no one ideal way to develop or distribute applications. Each method has its advantages and
            disadvantages. It is essential to consider the preferences of your target audience and choose an approach that aligns with their
            needs, whether it's for convenience or independence and privacy protection. Mobile development is the most restricted,
            essentially limited to the official store of the given platform with the exception of web applications. Personally, I prefer
            PWAs due to their development simplicity and independence from official channels, but unfortunately, PWAs are not suitable for
            all types of applications and features.

        <h2>Native Mobile Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Mobile applications have gained increasing importance in today's world. The primary distribution channel for mobile apps is
          through official app stores. For Android, it's the Google Play Store, and for iOS, it's the Apple App Store. Android apps are
          primarily developed in Kotlin/Java, whereas iOS apps are developed in Swift. The advantage of native development lies in the
          better integration and consistency within the platform. However, it comes with the drawback of costly development, as each
          platform requires a separate application, and ongoing maintenance is also expensive. Official Integrated Development Environments
          (IDEs) like Xcode and Android Studio are required to create the final package.
        </p>
        <h3>Frameworks</h3>
        <p>
          For those looking to create applications for multiple mobile platforms efficiently, technologies such as Flutter or React Native
          offer a unified solution. Flutter relies on the Dart programming language, while React Native employs JavaScript, which offers
          broader utility. The choice between Flutter and React Native depends on your specific project requirements and your team's
          familiarity with the respective technologies. Flutter is known for its high performance and visually appealing UI, while React
          Native offers a larger ecosystem and is often the preferred choice for web developers transitioning to mobile app development.
        </p>
        <h3>WebView</h3>
        <p>
          Capacitor.js is a project that encapsulates a web application within a native wrapper containing a WebView. The advantage here is
          the ability to generate platform-specific applications from a universal code with minor modifications. However, it is important to
          note that there is an external dependency on WebView, which may lead to compatibility issues with older devices or very recent
          technologies. The concept of using WebView can also be implemented without Capacitor. You simply need to create a WebView wrapper
          for each platform and load your application into it, either locally or externally from a web server.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of these methods rely to some extent on official distribution channels such as the Play Store and App Store. There are
          alternative options like F-Droid or APKPure, but they are not installed on every device, making them suitable for a limited user
          base. Another option is direct distribution of an APK package. In this scenario, users download the package and install it
          directly on their system. This method requires acceptance of security exceptions, indicating that it might not be the most secure
          approach since there is no guarantee that you are installing an official package without malware. Nonetheless, this method can be
          acceptable for distributing intranet applications to company employees, household members, or in cases where the application is
          intended for a specific, limited group of users. For corporate intranet applications, mobile device management (MDM) solutions are
          available if your company allows it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Uploading an application to the app store comes with associated fees, and the success of your app often depends on the decisions
          of another company, such as Google or Apple. Google Play Store imposes a one-time fee, while Apple, in addition to the initial
          fee, requires regular payments. There are also fees related to app sales and in-app purchases. On the other hand, for this price,
          you also get a very powerful marketing tool that can attract a large number of paying and non-paying users.

        <h2>Native Desktop Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Distributing desktop applications is significantly simpler. Different platforms offer their own app stores, but they are not as
          strictly required as they are for mobile devices. The choice of technologies used to develop your application is relatively open;
          the key is the ability to generate an executable file that runs on the target platform. These executable files or installation
          packages can then be distributed through official and unofficial stores, repositories, your own websites, and more. An interesting
          alternative may be PWAs, which are gaining increasing support on desktop platforms. The benefit lies in the ease of development,
          instant updates, and a single source code that can serve all platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a similar manner to mobile applications, it is possible to unify development for multiple platforms using a framework. Electron
          provides developers with Node.js, native APIs, and a web browser in one solution.

        <h2>Web Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Web applications are the simplest to develop, update, and distribute. They are not tied to official stores, as they are accessible
          through web browsers. However, they are reliant on the servers on which they operate. These servers necessitate ongoing
          maintenance, and a single server failure can render the application inaccessible to all users simultaneously. Among the major
          disadvantages are the costs associated with hosting + domain, and responsibility for user data, including compliance with all
          formal data protection requirements. Web apps don't require approval from app stores, eliminating the need to meet their
          guidelines and regulations. Web apps may not appear in app stores, making them less discoverable to users. Native apps often
          benefit from app store exposure.

        <h2>Progressive Web Apps (PWA)</h2>
        <p>
          Progressive web apps are an extension of web applications. PWAs distinguish themselves from regular websites by incorporating a
          manifest.json file and optionally a service worker. PWAs share all the advantages of web applications and also bring some
          advantages of native applications. The most obvious advantage is the appearance of the app, which is comparable to that of native
          apps. PWA applications require a secure context, which increases their security, but at the same time, it significantly limits
          their use on an intranet where obtaining a valid certificate is problematic. PWA applications are usually supported in official
          app stores, so besides distributing through the web, they can also gain new users on official stores, similar to native
          applications. The disadvantage of PWAs is their limited support in browsers and limited functionality, which unfortunately does
          not cover the full functionality of native apps even today.
        </p>
        Pros:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cross-Platform Compatibility: PWAs are accessible on various platforms and devices, making them compatible with different
            operating systems, including mobile and desktop.
          </li>
          <li>
            Low Deployment Barriers: Users don't need to download or install PWAs, reducing friction in app adoption. This can lead to
            higher user engagement and lower acquisition costs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Offline Access: PWAs can work offline or in low-network conditions, thanks to service workers that cache content, ensuring
            uninterrupted functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cost-Effective: Developing a single PWA can be more cost-effective than building separate native apps for multiple platforms, as
            you maintain a single codebase.
          </li>
          <li>
            App-Like User Experience: PWAs offer a responsive and app-like user experience with features like push notifications, a home
            screen icon, and smooth animations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Search Engine Optimization (SEO): PWAs can be optimized for search engines, increasing their discoverability and visibility in
            web search results.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quick Updates: Developers can make instant updates to PWAs, ensuring all users have access to the latest version without the
            need for app store approval.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved Performance: PWAs can load quickly and offer a responsive user experience, often outperforming traditional mobile
            websites.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Cons:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Limited Device Access: PWAs may have limited access to certain device features and hardware peripherals compared to native apps.
            Some advanced functionalities may not be possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Browser Compatibility: Ensuring consistent performance and features across different web browsers can be challenging. Some
            features may be browser-specific.
          </li>
          <li>
            Security Concerns: While PWAs offer inherent security advantages, they are not immune to web-related security risks such as
            cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lack of OS Integration: PWAs may not seamlessly integrate with the underlying operating system, limiting their ability to
            provide a fully native-like experience.
